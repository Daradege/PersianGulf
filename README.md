## Purpose

This repository is a digital campaign by Iranian developers to protect and promote the rightful name of **Persian Gulf** — a name that holds historical, cultural, and geographical significance.

We believe it is our duty as developers in the digital age to stand against misinformation and distortion of geographical facts. This is a peaceful and informative effort to raise awareness about the authentic name of the Persian Gulf.

## Historical Background

The name "Persian Gulf" has been historically and internationally recognized for over 2,500 years. From ancient Greek texts and Roman maps to modern international treaties and United Nations documents, this name has consistently appeared as **Persian Gulf**.

Historical figures such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Ptolemy all referred to this body of water as the Persian Gulf. It was also labeled as such on countless European maps during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

The United Nations has issued multiple official documents reaffirming the usage of "Persian Gulf" as the only correct geographical term.

Attempts to distort this historical fact are not only inaccurate but also politically motivated, and it's the responsibility of the global community—especially digital citizens—to stand for the truth.
